=Introduction

==What is atoum ?


Atoum is a unit test framework, similar to PHPUnit or SimpleTest, however:

* It is more modern and makes use of PHP's latest features.
* It is simpler to use and master.
* It is more intuitive and its syntax is as close as possible to the English natural language


==Download & Install

For now, atoum is not tagged with a version number. If you want to use atoum, just download the last stable version. atoum aims to provide backward compatibility anyway.

You can install atoum several ways :
* [[As a PHAR archive|#PHAR]]
* [[Using composer|#Composer]]
* [[Using an install script|#Installer]]
* [[Cloning the github repository|#Github]]
* [[Using a Symfony2 Bundle|#Symfony2-bundle]].
* [[Using a Zend Framework 2 component|#Zend-Framework-2-component]]


===PHAR

atoum is distributed as a PHAR archive, an archive format dedicated to PHP, available since PHP 5.3.

====Installation

You can download the latest stable version of atoum directly from the official website : [[http://downloads.atoum.org/nightly/mageekguy.atoum.phar|http://downloads.atoum.org/nightly/mageekguy.atoum.phar]]

====Updating

Updating atoum's PHAR is easy thanks to its command line tools :

[[[shell
php -d phar.readonly=0 mageekguy.atoum.phar --update
]]]

{{{info
To update atoum, PHP needs to be able to update PHAR archives, which is disabled by default, this is why you have to specify the option ##-d phar.readonly=0##.
}}}

If a newer version of atoum exists, it will be downloaded and installed in the archive itself :

[[[shell
php -d phar.readonly=0 mageekguy.atoum.phar --update
Checking if a new version is available... Done !
Update to version 'nightly-1568-201210311708'... Done !
Enable version 'nightly-1568-201210311708'... Done !
Atoum has been updated from version 'old-version' to 'nightly-1568-201210311708' successfully !
]]]

If no newer version is available, atoum will just stop without doing anything.

[[[shell
php -d phar.readonly=0 mageekguy.atoum.phar --update
Checking if a new version is available... Done !
There is no new version available !
]]]

atoum won't ask you for confirmation before proceeding with the update as it is very easy to go back to a previous version.

====Listing available versions present in atoum's archive

To show the list of versions contained in its archive, you'll use the ##\--list-available-versions## (or the shorter ##-lav##) argument.

[[[shell
php mageekguy.atoum.phar -lav
nightly-941-201201011548
* nightly-1568-201210311708
]]]

Available versions will be shown. The one prefixed with a ##*## is active.

====Updating the current version

To activate a different version of atoum, use the ##\--enable-version## (or the shorter ##-ev##) argument with the name of the version you want to activate.

[[[shell
php -d phar.readonly=0 mageekguy.atoum.phar -ev DEVELOPMENT
]]]

{{{info
Updating the current version of atoum needs PHP to be able to update PHAR archives, which is disabled by default, this is why you have to specify the option ##-d phar.readonly=0##.
}}}

====Removing older versions

If you want to remove a version of atoum from the archive, use the --delete-version (or shorter -dv) argument followed by the name of the version you want to remove.

[[[shell
php -d phar.readonly=0 mageekguy.atoum.phar -dv nightly-941-201201011548
]]]

The version will be removed.

{{{info
You cannot remove the active version.
}}}

{{{info
Removing a version of atoum needs PHP to be able to update PHAR archives, which is disabled by default, this is why you have to specify the option ##-d phar.readonly=0##.
}}}

===Composer

[[Composer|http://getcomposer.org/]] is a tool for dependency management in PHP.

Start by downloading and installing Composer

[[[shell
curl -s https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
]]]

Then, create a composer.json file at the root of your project, containing

[[[json
{
    "require": {
        "atoum/atoum": "dev-master"
    }
}
]]]

Finally execute :

[[[shell
php composer.phar install
]]]

===Installer

You will also be able to install atoum with its dedicated [[script|https://github.com/atoum/atoum-installer]]:

[[[shell
curl https://raw.github.com/atoum/atoum-installer/master/installer | php -- --phar
php mageekguy.atoum.phar -v
atoum version nightly-xxxx-yyyymmddhhmm by Frédéric Hardy (phar:///path/to/mageekguy.atoum.phar)
]]]

This script lets you install atoum locally (in a project, see the previous example) or as a system-wide utility:

[[[shell
curl https://raw.github.com/atoum/atoum-installer/master/installer | sudo php -- --phar --global
which atoum
/usr/local/bin/atoum
]]]

Options are available and let you tweak the installation process : see the [[documentation|https://github.com/atoum/atoum-installer/blob/master/README.md]] for more details.

===Github

If you want to use atoum directly from its sources, you can clone or fork its git repository on github : git://github.com/atoum/atoum.git

===Symfony 1 plugin

If you want to use atoum in a symfony 1 project, you can do so thanks to the [[sfAtoumPlugin plugin|https://github.com/atoum/sfAtoumPlugin]]

Install instructions are available on the project's page.

===Symfony2 bundle

If you want to use atoum in a Symfony2 project, you can do so thanks to the [[atoum Bundle|https://github.com/atoum/AtoumBundle]].

Install instructions are available on the project's page.

===Zend Framework 2 component

A library is available to use atoum with Zend Framework 2. Documentation and examples are available at the following address : [[https://github.com/blanchonvincent/zend-framework-test-atoum|https://github.com/blanchonvincent/zend-framework-test-atoum]].

You'll find every install instructions there.

==A quick overview of atoum's philosophy

===Very basic example

atoum wants you to write a test class for each class you want to test. As an example, if you want to test the famous HelloTheWorld class, you'll have to write the test\units\HelloTheWorld test class.

NOTE : atoum is, of course, namespaces aware. As an example, to test the Hello\The\World class, you'll write the \Hello\The\tests\units\World class.

Here is the code of your HelloTheWorld class that we'll be using as a first example. This class will be located in PROJECT_PATH/classes/HelloTheWorld.php

[[[php
<?php
/**
 * The class to be tested
 */
class HelloTheWorld
{
    public function getHiAtoum ()
    {
        return "Hi atoum !";
    }
}
]]]

Now, let's write our first test class. This class will be located in PROJECT_PATH/tests/HelloTheWorld.php

[[[php
<?php
//Your test classes are in a dedicated namespace
namespace tests\units;

//You have to include your tested class
require_once __DIR__.'/../classes/HelloTheWorld.php';

//You now include atoum, using its phar archive
require_once __DIR__.'/atoum/mageekguy.atoum.phar';

use \mageekguy\atoum;

/**
 * Test class for \HelloTheWorld
 * Test classes extend from atoum\test
 */
class HelloTheWorld extends atoum\test
{
    public function testGetHiAtoum ()
    {
        //new instance of the tested class
        $helloToTest = new \HelloTheWorld();

        $this->assert
                    //we expect the getHiAtoum method to return a string
                    ->string($helloToTest->getHiAtoum())
                    //and the string should be Hi atoum !
                    ->isEqualTo('Hi atoum !');
    }
}
]]]

Now, let's launch the tests

[[[shell
php -f ./test/HelloTheWorld.php
]]]

You will see something like this

[[[shell
> atoum version nightly-941-201201011548 by Frédéric Hardy (phar:///home/documentation/projects/tests/atoum/mageekguy.atoum.phar/1)

Success (1 test, 1/1 method, 2 assertions, 0 error, 0 exception) !
]]]

We've just tested that the getHiAtoum method :
* returns a string;
* and that this string is the expected 'Hi atoum !' string.

All tests passed. You're done, your code is rock solid !

===Rule of Thumb

The basics when you’re testing things using atoum are the following :
*    Tell atoum what you want to work on (a variable, an object, a string, an integer, …)
*    Tell atoum the state the element is expected to be in (is equal to, is null, exists, …).

==Using atoum with your favorite IDE

==Sublime Text 2

A [[SublimeText 2 plugin|https://github.com/toin0u/Sublime-atoum]] enables you to launch tests and see the results directly in the editor.

Required instructions to install the plugin are available here [[the author's blog|http://sbin.dk/2012/05/19/atoum-sublime-text-2-plugin/]].

==VIM

atoum is bundled with a plugin dedicated to VIM.

It enables you to launch tests without leaving VIM, and to get the matching report in the editor's screen.

You can navigate through potential errors, directly going to the line where assertions failed thanks to matching key strokes.

===Installing the VIM plugin

If you're not using the PHAR archive, you'll find the plugin in resources/vim/atoum.vba.

If you're using the PHAR archive, you can ask atoum to extract the file with the command line

[[[shell
php mageekguy.atoum.phar --extractResourcesTo path/to/a/directory
]]]

Once you have the atoum.vba file, use VIM to edit its content

[[[shell
vim path/to/atoum.vba
]]]

And ask VIM to install the plugin with

[[[vim
:source %
]]]

===Using atoum and VIM

Of course, to work properly, the plugin needs to be correctly installed, and you're supposed to be editing a test case based on atoum.

The following command line asks for tests execution:

[[[vim
:Atoum
]]]

Tests are launched and a report, based on your atoum configuration in ftplugin/php/atoum.vim of your .vim directory, is generated in a new screen.

Feel free to link this command with a shortcut of your own. i.e. adding the following line to your .vimrc file :

[[[vim
nnoremap *.php :Atoum
]]]

The F12 function key will now trigger the :Atoum command.

===Managing atoum's configuration file

You can specify another configuration file by adding the following line to your .vimrc file:

[[[vim
call atoum#defineConfiguration('/path/to/project/directory', '/path/to/atoum/configuration/file', '.php')
]]]

The atoum#defineConfiguration function enables you to define the configuration file to use based on your unit test directory.

it takes 3 arguments :
* The path to the unit tests directory
* The path to the atoum's configuration file to be considered
* The extension of the unit test files that will be concerned

If you want to know more about the plugin, you can use the embedded help in VIM thanks to the following command :

[[[vim
:help atoum
]]]
